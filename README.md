# arduino-modbus-codesys

These firmwares configure Arduino Uno/Mega as Modbus input/output boards. This is especially useful for teaching purposes, as it provides hardware compatible with commercial PLC programming solutions such as CoDeSys at a low cost.

This project uses the excellent work of fulano for all things Modbus protocol related by providing a device that is easy to use and allows the student to abstract from low level work and focus on automation design and implementation.

I use CoDeSys in my automation classes because it provides a modern software solution free of charge, It is compatible with a vast number of PCLs/brands, and supports the IEC-61131 standard, which is specially useful for teaching the automation basis at degree level.
